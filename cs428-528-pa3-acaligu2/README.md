HTTP Proxy - CS 428 Project 3

All aspects of the proxy work as expected

All resources listed in the assignment description downloaded succesfully using the proxy
and show no differences when compared to the standard wget download

I timed the HTTP request using microseconds then converted to milliseconds
at the end because the cache hits were too quick to be detected
